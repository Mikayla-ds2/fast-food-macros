A personalized nutrtion explorer for fast food lovers who want to eat smarter. 
Fast food macros is a web app that lets users explore and compare the nutritional information of popular fast food items using custom nutritional scores. 
Whether you’re watching protein, sodium, sugar, or trying to find the best macros at Chick-fil-A, this tool helps you make data-informed choices without giving up your favorites.
I made this project because I wanted to do something fun with data and health, and particulary needed to work on my web development skills! 
I first researched popular fast food items from popular restaurants, their nutritional information, and pricing from DoorDash. I then cleaned and standardized my data using Jupyter Notebook and pandas. 
I used percentile-based fuzzy scoring to normalize metrics like sodium and cholesterol. 
When creating nutritional scores, I ensured both positive and negative macronutrients were accounted for properly. 
I used SvelteKit to help scaffold out the website and used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve or customize elements such as radar charts and clickable item cards. 
I added fitlers and match/similarity scores based on user preferences. 
I for sure struggled with the scoring logic, deciding how to weigh particular macronutrients. I attempted many different methods of clustering and scoring.
This is a very fun and challenging project, and I enjoyed it a lot!
